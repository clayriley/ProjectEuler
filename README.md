# ProjectEuler
Implementations of solutions to the Project Euler problem series.

## Largest product in a series
Problem 8

Given a particular window size that slides along subsequences of an integer, 
what is the largest product of the elements of the window?

There are two implementations to this problem supplied in product_series.py.  
Both support a generalized function that is specified when the script is used.  
The script does not accept arbitrary functions for security reasons.

## Names scores
Problem 22

Given a list of names, sort them alphabetically.  Sum the character values of 
each and weight the result by its sorted position.  What is the total for the 
entire names list?

## Counting rectangles
Problem 85

Find the dimensions of a rectangle that contains a number of (sub)-rectangles 
that is the closest possible to some target.  What is that rectangle's area?
